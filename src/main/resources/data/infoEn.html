<p>The application has:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Import of data exported from power network analyzers of companies:
    <ol start="4">
      <li>Sonel &ndash; standard data for the network and harmonic content data with THD, in separate ".csv" files exported from the <em>Sonel Analysis program</em> <em>version 4.6.x </em>(at least version 4.6.0). Possible import in English and Polish.</li>
      <li>A-Eberle &ndash; standard network data and harmonic content data with THD, in separate ".csv" files exported from <em>WinPQ mobil </em>(version 6.1.2.1). Possible import in English. IMPORTANT. When exporting from WinPQ mobil, check the <i>"Suppress Headers "</i> option.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Preview of the above-mentioned data with saving to a text file in various formats of representation of numbers (i.e. floating point and scientific format).</li>
  <li>A simple and functional creator of line charts from imported data with the option of saving them.</li>
  <li>Report generator in <em>". </em>docx&rdquo; in Polish, containing the assessment of compliance of parameters based <br />on the Regulation of the Minister of Economy of May 4, 2007 on detailed conditions for the operation of the power system, Journal of Laws No. 93, item 623.</li>
</ul>
<p>To generate the report it is important that both types of data have been imported. Additionally, they should include at least:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Average RMS values of phase voltages (each phase: <em>L1 </em>, <em>L2 </em>, <em>L3 </em>),</li>
  <li>Negative sequence voltage unbalance factor,</li>
  <li>Light flicker nuisance coefficient for each of the 3 phases (collected by Sonel analyzers, calculated from the coefficient for A-Eberle analysers),</li>
  <li>The value of the harmonic distortion factor THD for each of the 3 phases,</li>
  <li>Value of the level of each of the voltage harmonics (min. up to 40) for each of the 3 phases (SonelAnalysis - data export in [%], WinPQ - data export in [V])/</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, the report will be incomplete, will be generated incorrectly or it will not be possible to generate and save the report.</p>
